This is some code I wrote to scrape MPs tweets.  The idea of the project was to understand how MPs interact with science/research.  It turned into a broader research project the results of which can be found here:

The code itâ€™s self is pretty scrappy as it written in a hurry then left, but so do what you want with it. :)
